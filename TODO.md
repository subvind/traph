after todo: i will update my code base with the submitted files and run
the program ... if there is an error then it will be placed within ./CURRENT_ERROR.md
otherwise assume i have updated my requirements.

durring todo: if there is an error within ./CURRENT_ERROR.md then help me solve that
otherwise don't worry about it and proceed with the following todo rules.

TODO RULES:
 1) return a ./src/<filename>.js file
 2) i'd like JavaScript code in response to my queries!
 3) keep console.log statements for debugging
 4) keep code comments for documentation
